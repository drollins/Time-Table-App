        <h2>Say goodbye to torn,<br> beer-stained paper timetables!</h2>
        
        <p>With the Unofficial Falls Festival timetable app you can view the line up of bands for each day and add bands to your personal time-table with one touch. Once you've added the bands you want to see, you'll be able to view your personal time-table, be aware of any potential clashes and plan your day with ease! </p>

              <h3>This is not an official Falls Festival App!</h3>
              <p>This app is in no way associated with the Falls Festival. We're just a couple of
              Falls regulars who decided that we were sick of having to rely
              of time-tables torn out of newspapers to organise our days at the Falls Festival -
              our solution was to build this app, which we've decided to share with everyone.</p>
              
              <p>So add this app to your iPhone, use it, and if you like it all we ask
              is that you tell you friends and get them to use it too!</p>
